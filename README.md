# Smart-Thermometer

For this program, I code a program to simulate the change in color of a smart thermometer based on the user's input. The program is bounded in temperature from 0 to 100 where on the lower end of temperature, colors vary in shades of blue and cyan; temperatures closer to the midpoint vary in shades of green; temperatures on the high end of temperature vary in warm shades such as red and yellow. As outputs, the program will print the user with the temperature, a hex code for the following color, and a color number. A data validation function is implemented in an implementation file and stored as a prototype in a header file to correctly validate the value from the user. Specifically, if the user enters a value outside the parameter or inputs an invalid input (strings or characters for example) a while loop is implemented to validate correct data.
